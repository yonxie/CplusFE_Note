## Mistakes Made

### 1. Chapter 5

- Only use `friend` when declare a function, but not when define a function.
- No type is needed when declare and define constructors.
- Memeber function names in class cannot be the same with member data name.
- Declare type `ostream&` when overloading `<<`.
- `<<` is a binary operator with first arguement of type `ostream&` and second arguement string.
